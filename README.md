# Face-emotion-recognition

**Overview**

This project is an implementation of a Face Emotion Recognition system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The goal of this project is to accurately recognize emotions from facial expressions in real-time images or video streams. The model is designed to detect and classify various facial expressions, including happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, fear, and neutral emotions.

**Features**

Real-time Emotion Recognition: The CNN model is capable of analyzing facial expressions in real-time, making it suitable for applications that require live emotion detection from camera feeds or video streams.

**Multi-class Emotion Classification:**

The model can classify facial emotions into multiple classes, such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, fear, and neutral, providing a comprehensive understanding of the subject's emotional state.

**Deep Learning Architecture:** 

The CNN architecture used for emotion recognition is capable of automatically learning and extracting meaningful features from facial images, enabling accurate emotion prediction.

**Pre-trained Model Option: **

For faster development and deployment, a pre-trained CNN model may be included as part of this project. However, it is recommended to train the model on a custom dataset specific to the user's application for optimal accuracy.

**User-friendly Interface:**

The implementation may include a user-friendly interface that allows users to interact with the emotion recognition system easily.

**Dataset**

The emotion recognition model requires a labeled dataset of facial images representing different emotional expressions. A popular dataset "FER-2013" was used for training the model. Ensure that the dataset is divided into training, validation, and testing subsets to evaluate the model's performance.
